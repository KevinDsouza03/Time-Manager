Time Manager App:

Purpose: 
    - Block applications and sites that are distracting when wanting to do work.
    - Sessions for work w. blocking.
    - Track time spent "consuming".
    - Application, not web-app for tracking.


How to:
Block Applications:
    - 

Block Websites:
    - 

Get Data/Track Time: 1
    - Pywin32 Libary 
    - Get Focused Window DONE
    - Run on an Interval DONE
    - Store what was focused. // Ideas: csv file for easy exporting. Then can be interpreted elsewhere. DONE

Focus Session:
    - Check pyvda python, time-tracker-cli ?


Interpretating Data:
    - Current: Use program to get data about your usage, then can be interpreted with a web app? Streamlit?
    - Datetime subtraction until focused changes, so we can total time spent on applications.



Tools/Format:
    - Windows: Open a new desktop for the work session, so when "unlocked", just open old desktop.
